# Docker Compose Up - DEVOPS-0
# Date: 2026-01-08

$ docker compose up -d

Note: Docker is not available in this CI environment.
The docker-compose.yml configuration has been created and validated syntactically.

docker-compose.yml defines:
- MySQL 8.0 on port 3306 with healthcheck
- MinIO (S3-compatible) on ports 9000 (API) and 9001 (Console) with healthcheck

To verify locally:
1. Run: docker compose up -d
2. Wait for healthchecks to pass
3. Run: docker compose ps (should show both services as healthy)
4. Run: pnpm db:push to initialize schema
